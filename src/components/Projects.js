                            I had an incredible time at Traya Health, where I
                            got to dive into exciting projects and work with an
                            amazing team. From giving the product drawer a fresh
                            look with TypeScript and React Query to redesigning
                            the How-to-Use Products page (which boosted user
                            satisfaction by 20%!), every day was a new
                            adventure. I also tackled migrating project assets
                            to a CDN, slashing page load times by 30%, and used
                            TypeScript to cut bugs by 25%. The highlight?
                            Collaborating with talented colleagues and soaking
                            up all the knowledge Bangalore had to offer. It was
                            more than just workâ€”it was a fantastic learning
                            experience and a lot of fun!
